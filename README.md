# 1️⃣ Project Overview

This project analyzes Coursera courses (2025) with a complete data science workflow, including:

- Dataset cleaning and preprocessing  
- Skills extraction and normalization  
- Instructor–course mapping  
- Category-level analytics  
- Power BI modeling and dashboard structuring  

🎯 **Goal:**  
Understand how online learning platforms (like Coursera) structure *skills*, *instructors*, and *course architecture* — and connect these findings to global educational challenges, especially quality, accessibility, and the need for deep competencies.

# 2️⃣ Dataset Workflow

### 📌 Dataset Source
- **Dataset name:** *Coursera Courses Metadata for Data and Learning Analytics (2025)*  
- **Collected by:** *Phi Long Nguyen*  
- **Origin:** Coursera  
- **Hosted on:** Kaggle  
  ➝ https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phi-long-nguyen/coursera-courses-metadata-2025  

### 🧹 Main Processing Steps  
1. **Import the dataset** (CSV).  
2. **Clean text columns**: remove symbols, fix malformed brackets, standardize lists.  
3. **Explode multi-value fields**:  
   - `skills`  
   - `instructors`  
4. **Create final relational tables**:  
   - `coursera_skills`  
   - `coursera_instructors`  
   - `coursera_data` (course-level summary)  
5. **Prepare for Power BI**:  
   - URL used as primary key  
   - Relationship model  
6. **Export** as clean CSVs for analysis and dashboarding.

# 4️⃣ Key Observations

- **Historical fields** (Health, Business, Social Sciences) have many instructors and diverse courses.  
- **Tech fields** (IT, CS, DS) are *specialized* but have *very few instructors*.  
- Courses with many skills do not always align with strong instructor availability.  
- MOOCs democratize education but also reveal **structural imbalances in global expertise availability**.  
- If instructor shortage persists in tech fields, pedagogical depth may decrease.

---

# 5️⃣ Pedagogical & Policy Implications

- Encourage a shift from **diploma accumulation** to **competency-based learning**.  
- Train more **high-quality instructors** in emerging technology domains.  
- Build deep, structured **learning pathways** aligned with job market needs.  
- Aligns with **UN SDG4: Quality Education**  
  → Promoting lifelong learning, instructor professionalization, and equitable access to knowledge.  
- Ensure sustainability of MOOCs by reducing instructor overload.
